# BinaryJS Reference
In BinaryJS, Converter objects, which define a certain user-specific datatype or structure, have to be created first before any encoding/decoding can be performed.

All Converter objects come with two methods:
### Converter.encode(data)
Encodes the given data, which matches the previously defined datatype or structure, into a binary format, stored using the **UTF-8 encoding**. Each character encodes one byte ranging from 0-255.
### Converter.decode(string)
Decodes the given string, which was generated by encoding data through the same helper object, back into the previously defined datatype or structure. If no errors are made, this output will be exactly equal to the input passed to the `Converter.encode` method.

## Converter types

There are different types of Converters, each built for their respective datatype/structure:
### Boolean
**Instanciation syntax:**
```
new Binary.Boolean()
```
